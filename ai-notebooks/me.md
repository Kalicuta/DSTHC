- Introduction
Hello I'm Z, from C's group.

I joined MRG in late 2015, right after I finished my graduate study in Physics.
I spent my first two years or so working on commodity valuation models. 
Then I moved to the current group 
firstly reviewing the models for Asset Management group.
and currently are responsible for the CIB credit models for corporate bonds, loans and other cash products.

I didn't have the chance to do an internship here in JP; 
I did see many summer interns in the past years
returned as full time associates after the internship.
I also worked with interns on different projects,
and this summer I'm very happy to have Vanessa Kwarteng in my team and work on the callable bond review project. 

I hope I can provide some helpful infomation for your internship in MRGR today. 


two-way .. 
from a manager's perspective, want to show that JPM and MRG is a great ..

- Can you elaborate how you have changed over the years working at JPM? What have you learned form your work? From asso to VP, are there any changes in terms of your attitude or responsibility that you want ot share with us?

Before I start to reflect on my growth over the past years
maybe I can mention a bit about the learning oppotunities in JP and MRGR, assuming many people are interested. 

    - JP offers a lot of training programs for different levels and business lines. 
    For example, every year we have two-week all-day QR training for new joiners.
    Our colleagues from QR, MRQR, MR and Trading will give lectures covering all the topics relevant to their day-to-day job and business.
    - Firmwide we have on-site and remote training on leadership, writing skills, communication, every month and you are always encouraged to 
    sign up. 
    - MRGR also offers training programs every year, I just received a sign-up email for 2 month machine learning training offered by Pavan's group. 
    - We also have Lunch and Learn series, mentor program. 
    There are a ton for oppotunities to learn. 

- Now come back to myself.

When I just came out of the school, I focused a lot on the testing I was told to perform, and the tasks I was assigned.
 Also by participating in those training programs I mentioned, and with the help from my colleagues, managers, 
I was just getting more and more comfortable with the technical skills needed in day-to-day job.

I grow gradually awareness that I was not in an isolated team but a stakeholder that really needs to continuously and effectively communicate with 
people from many different teams,  

I definitly gained a new / deep perspective on TEAMWORK/communication over the years. 


communication 
 - benchmarking testing, communicate with QR

sometimes it takes a few hours, a few days, pondering your counterparty's arguments.  
.. 
push you to understand the models and the business better. 








Teamwork
In the begining, I just focused on the testing I did, the tasks I was assigned. 
After worked on more and more projects and see more models, read more review reports from more experienced colleagues,
gradually 
grow more sense in terms of what all the stakeholders' perspectives, what's QR's concern, 



find problem, deal with them 


all models are wrong, but some are useful

use that projects as the step stones to ... 
constantly ask yourself if you could do better if you had more time or resource. 



training



trading models -> forecasting models.

**Introduction** 

Hello I'm Z, from C's group.

I joined MRG in late 2015, right after I finished my graduate study in Physics.
I spent my first two years or so working on commodity valuation models. 
Then I moved to the current group 
firstly reviewing the vendor models for Asset Management group covering a wide range of the asset classes. 
and currently I'm responsible for the CIB credit models for corporate bonds, loans and other cash products.

I didn't have the chance to do an internship here in JP; 
But I worked with interns on different projects,
I saw many summer interns in the past years returned as full time associates after their internship.
This summer I'm very happy to have Vanessa Kwarteng in my team working on the callable bond review project. 

Today I hope I can provide some useful infomation for your internship in MRGR.

**Can you elaborate how you have changed over the years working at JPM? What have you learned form your work? 
From asso to VP, are there any changes in terms of your attitude or responsibility that you want ot share with us?**

Before I start to reflect on my growth over the past years
maybe I can mention a bit about the learning oppotunities in JP and MRGR, assuming many people are interested. 

  - JP offers a lot of training programs for different levels and business lines. 
  For example, every year we have two-week all-day QR training for new joiners.
  Our colleagues from QR, MRQR, MR and Trading will give lectures covering all the topics relevant to their day-to-day job and business.
  - Firmwide we have on-site and remote training on leadership, writing skills, communication, every month and you are always encouraged to 
  sign up. 
  - MRGR also offers training programs regularly, I just received a sign-up email for 2 month machine learning training offered by Pavan's group. 
  - We also have Lunch and Learn series, mentor program. 
  There are a ton for oppotunities to learn. 

Now come back to myself.

When I just came out of the school, I focused a lot on the testing I was told to perform, and the tasks I was assigned, 
I gradually got more and more comfortable with the technical skills needed in day-to-day job.

While, over the years, it has become increasingly clearer to me that communication is the key to an effective workplace, the success of our group.
When I was a junior in the team, most of my communication was with your managers and team members, who usually shared the same 
perspective with me. our disagreements if any are mostly on the technical details.

Then gradually I had to present and explain your review findings and testing results in front of a broader audiance. 
In many cases people could have different views or conclusion with respect to analysis results.
It forced me to learn how to understand and respect their point of view. 
at the same time, pushes you to understand the models, the business and the regulatory requirements better. 
and think from their perspectives. 

It could take hours even days just pondering other stakeholder's arguments, or just trying to figure out
how to articulate and convey my arguments effectively. 

On that I want to say
our management did give us a lot support and advice such as on how to build strong relationship with the stakeholders on a daily basis. 
If we can know and understand the concerns from different stakeholders like model users, market risks, in the early stage of the
review, it can make our job much easier.


**What are career mobility opportunities in MRG**

I felt there are many mobility oppotunities in MRG, including the oppotunities from QR, MRQR. 
I do know some colleagues moved to QR or MR, and some joined MRG from those groups.

Within MRGR I think we definetely have more such oppotunities, 
We have internal job openning portal. 
it's totally ok to talk to the team that you are interested in about the job opennings. 
In terms of career development and career choice, I would say our management do respect us a lot. 

one model submission was delayed I had two months
meanwhile my manager told me that the wholesale team was busy to meet the CCAR deadline,

communication 
 - benchmarking testing, communicate with QR


two-way .. 
from a manager's perspective, want to show that JPM and MRG is a great .. 


After worked on more and more projects and see more models, read more review reports from more experienced colleagues,
gradually 
grow more sense in terms of what all the stakeholders' perspectives, what's QR's concern, 



find problem, deal with them 


all models are wrong, but some are useful

use that projects as the step stones to ... 
constantly ask yourself if you could do better if you had more time or resource. 



training



trading models -> forecasting models.
